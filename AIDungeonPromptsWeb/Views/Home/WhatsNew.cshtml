				<ul>
					<li>Various layout changes - please let us know in the thread if this is better or worse for you.</li>
					<li>The search options have increased - namely you can fuzzy search (i.e an exact match isn't needed) as well as search for posts containing any of your given tags, rather than only the ones that match all the given tags.</li>
					<li>Changed dates to a more international friendly version.</li>
					<li>Submitting a new prompt will now warn you if a prompt with the same name already exists.</li>

				<h5 class="card-title">2020/11/15 - Release 1.1</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Wrapped Prompt properties in code tags for easier copy pasting.</li>
					<li>Front page is now just the search page - the old search page has been removed. Old searches should redirect to the new one.</li>
					<li>Added a report system - use this if someone posts your personal details or tries to post spam.</li>
					<li>We now have an actual domain: <a href="https://prompts.aidg.club/">https://prompts.aidg.club/</a>. The old url isn't going anywhere, but this one is much nicer.</li>
					<li>We've moved the Prompts from "/prompts" to just the root url. The old links should redirect to the new one.</li>
					<li>An issue where taking too long to submit the Create Prompt form would cause the submit to fail should be fixed - please let us know in the thread if it isn't!</li>
