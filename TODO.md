# TODO

## Short term:

- Allow tag search to be "OR" instead of just "AND" (I noticed this problem when realising that a lot of the prompts from the pastebin used a variation of "monstergirl", "monster girl", or "monster girls")
- Proper url
- Allow users to edit/delete (will last until they remove their browser cookies)
- Search by/between date
- Add view counts and allow filtering on it

## Longer term:
- Bulk upload
- Export options
- Better frontend
